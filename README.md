### Server code not included (Probably will add in the future).

Basically what this app does is that it listens to a text formatted by "COMMAND:PASSWORD" on the server side and locks the workstation (where the server is located) if the sent message is formatted correctly and the password is correct.

On the client side, all running devices on the same network you are connected to are shown and you get to select which one you want to send the message to.


**This is my first TCP Communication project.**
